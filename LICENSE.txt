ABOUT THE USE OF MASS EFFECT INFORMATION/ART

Mass Effect is probably copyrighted/trademarked by BioWare/Electronic Arts.
This program does not intend to challenge the copyright/trademark, or infringe
on it.

To be clear: Everything "Mass Effect", implicitly or explicitly, is owned by
BioWare/Electronic Arts.

Some of the traits reproduce or are inspired by traits from the Mass Effect
games, and sometimes extend them. Again, this is not intended as a challenge or
infringement.

This is a fan creation, free of charge, usable by anyone willing to enjoy the
Mass Effect universe beyond the video games.


ABOUT THE USE OF MASS EFFECT: NOUVELLE ERE INFORMATION

Everything written about for MASS EFFECT also applies to MASS EFFECT: NOUVELLE
ERE, authored by Renaud Lottiaux.

Mebo takes inspiration from MASS EFFECT: NOUVELLE ERE, adjust/modify some, etc.
